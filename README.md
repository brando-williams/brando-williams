## Brandon Williams
Research Associate focused on Asset Composition and Shareholder Information in the Asset Management Industry serving Individual Investors. 

## About Me
I am intellectually curious and motivated. I constantly evaluate my skill set and look to create challenging, fast-paced environments and opportunities that allow me to improve and share my knowledge. 

I hold a Bachelor of Science in Economics and Mathematics from the University of Mary Washington, where I was a member of the Diversity and Inclusion Committee and represented the men's Lacrosse Team on the Student Athletic Advisory Committee (SAAC). In my free time, I enjoy reading about Data Analysis, the Retirement Industry, and Macroeconomics. 

My current work typically includes supporting various surveys by collecting data, addressing inquiries, conducting quality assessments, and investigating anomalies. My past research experience includes parameter estimation in nonlinear regression, analyzing macroeconomic trends and topics, and evaluating business projections by forecasting consumer demand. I am eager to transition into a role that integrates my analytical research skills with my expertise in data creation. 

## Portfolio
This portfolio showcases a collection of my notebooks, highlighting my data analysis skill set attained through my graduate program. During my undergraduate studies, I majored in economics and mathematics, focusing on Applied Statistics and Actuarial Science. This background underscores my analytical thinking and ability to explore new and undeveloped concepts. However, my undergraduate experience involved limited exposure to programming and machine learning. I delved deeper into these areas during my graduate studies to address this.

### Machine Learning and Predictive Analytics 
The main objective of this course is to obtain a comprehensive grasp of the theory and practical applications of supervised and unsupervised learning, covering topics such as regression, classification, and clustering. A vital component of this course is to develop further statistical software, which is utilized heavily in labs and assignments and may be encountered in practical applications outside the classroom. 

### Decision Modeling
I developed a robust understanding of decision modeling, which enhances decision-making under uncertainty. I applied statistical techniques to decision models across diverse business contexts, including discrete choice, simulation, and forecasting models. This experience has equipped me with the skills to tackle complex data analytics challenges effectively.

### Competing Through Business Analytics 
I studied the latest business analytics insights, focusing on how companies use these tools for competitive advantage. I learned about performance metrics, data visualization, process improvement, algorithm development, and the ethical implications of analytics. This training has equipped me to support strategic and operational decision-making effectively.

### Optimization and Prescriptive Analytics
I studied optimization, a crucial part of business, and prescriptive analytics. I covered vital areas such as linear programming, discrete optimization, specialized networks, nonlinear programming, and heuristic approximations. This training has equipped me to determine the best action with available resources.

### Big Data and Cloud Computing Technologies
I mastered machine learning and big data technologies designed to handle the vast data sets generated by the Internet and the “Internet of Things.” This training has prepared me to tackle modern data challenges effectively.

### Artificial Intelligence Applications for Business
I focused on applying artificial intelligence (AI) in business contexts. I gained hands-on experience with contemporary AI techniques, including deep learning, natural language processing, and planning, to solve various business problems. This training has equipped me with the skills to implement AI solutions effectively in real-world scenarios.
