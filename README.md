# Data Analytics Portfolio

## Brandon Williams
Research Associate focused on Asset Composition and Shareholder Information in the Asset Management Industry serving Individual Investors. 

## About Me
I am intellectually curious and motivated. I constantly evaluate my skill set and look to create challenging, fast-paced environments and opportunities that allow me to improve and share my knowledge. 

I hold a Bachelor of Science in Economics and Mathematics from the University of Mary Washington, where I was a Diversity and Inclusion Committee member and represented the men's Lacrosse Team on the Student Athletic Advisory Committee (SAAC). I enjoy reading about Data Analytics, the Retirement Industry, and Macroeconomics (reword) in my free time. 

My current work typically includes supporting various surveys by collecting data, addressing inquiries, conducting quality assessments, and investigating anomalies. My past research experience includes parameter estimation in nonlinear regression, analyzing macroeconomic trends and topics, and evaluating business projections by forecasting consumer demand. I am eager to transition into a role that integrates my analytical research skills with my expertise in data creation. 

## Portfolio
This portfolio showcases a collection of my notebooks, highlighting my data analytics skill set attained through my graduate program. During my undergraduate studies, I majored in economics and mathematics, focusing on Applied Statistics and Actuarial Science. This background underscores my analytical thinking and ability to explore new and undeveloped concepts. However, my undergraduate experience involved limited exposure to programming and machine learning. I delved deeper into these areas during my graduate studies to address this.

### Machine Learning and Predictive Analytics 
The main objective of this course is to obtain a comprehensive grasp of the theory and practical applications of supervised and unsupervised learning, covering topics such as regression, classification, and clustering.  

### Decision Modeling
In this course, I developed a robust understanding of decision modeling, which enhances decision-making under uncertainty. I also applied statistical techniques to decision models across diverse business contexts, including discrete choice, simulation, and forecasting models, equipping me with the skills to effectively tackle complex data analytics challenges.

### Competing Through Business Analytics 
By studying the latest business analytics insights, I focused on understanding how companies use these insights for competitive advantage. I superficially understood insights such as performance metrics, data visualization, process improvement, algorithm development, and the ethical implications of these analytics. This course has equipped me with the necessary tools to effectively support strategic and operational decision-making.

### Optimization and Prescriptive Analytics
Optimization and prescriptive analytics are crucial parts of business. In this course, I covered vital areas such as linear programming, discrete optimization, specialized networks, nonlinear programming, and heuristic approximations, allowing me to determine the best action with available resources.

### Big Data and Cloud Computing Technologies
For this course, I began understanding machine learning and big data technologies designed to handle the vast data sets generated by the Internet and the “Internet of Things,” preparing me to tackle modern data challenges effectively.

### Artificial Intelligence Applications for Business
I focused on applying artificial intelligence (AI) in business by gaining hands-on experience with contemporary AI techniques, including deep learning, natural language processing, and planning, to solve various business problems. This course taught me how to implement AI solutions effectively in real-world scenarios.
