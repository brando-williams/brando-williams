# Data Analytics Portfolio

## About Me
I am intellectually curious and motivated. I constantly evaluate my skill set and look to create challenging, fast-paced environments and opportunities that allow me to improve and share my knowledge. 

I hold a Bachelor of Science in Economics and Mathematics from the University of Mary Washington, where I was a Diversity and Inclusion Committee member and represented the men's Lacrosse Team on the Student Athletic Advisory Committee (SAAC). I enjoy reading about Data Analytics, the Retirement Industry, and Macroeconomics (reword) in my free time. 

My current work typically includes supporting various surveys by collecting data, addressing inquiries, conducting quality assessments, and investigating anomalies. My past research experience includes parameter estimation in nonlinear regression, analyzing macroeconomic trends and topics, and evaluating business projections by forecasting consumer demand. I am eager to transition into a role that integrates my analytical research skills with my expertise in data creation. 

## Portfolio
This portfolio showcases a collection of my notebooks, highlighting my data analytics skill set attained through my graduate program. During my undergraduate studies, I majored in economics and mathematics, focusing on Applied Statistics and Actuarial Science. This background underscores my analytical thinking and ability to explore new and undeveloped concepts. However, my undergraduate experience involved limited exposure to programming and machine learning. I delved deeper into these areas during my graduate studies to address this.

### Undergraduate Research Papers
